      Hard day at work? Stressed by tight deadlines? Not living up to your own
      expectations? Singer, dancer, and inspirational speaker Jamie
      "Goldierocks" Joong-Watts will spin you 'round on a whirlwind tour of

      a square peg in a round hoop.
    </p>

    <p>
      Beginners and experts alike will have something to learn from this
      presentation, and we'll be starting with a through review of the basics
      (ab-spin, hip continuation flick, bracelet twist, and of course the ankle
      start) so even first-timers will have no trouble following along.
